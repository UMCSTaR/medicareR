## Background
In 2019, we purchased more than 100 procedures that are commonly performed by general surgery surgeons from CMS. The purchased procedures went back from 2007. Since we already have Medicare data from 2007-2016 for the original 5 procedures, we received the purchased procedures in separate datasets. After 2016, all newly added procedures and original 5 procedures are together in one data file each year.
